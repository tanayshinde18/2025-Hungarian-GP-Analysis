# Formula 1 Race Data Analysis

This project is the initial phase of a Formula 1 race prediction and analytics tool using the [FastF1 API](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/).  
The current progress focuses on setting up the environment, retrieving raw race data, and preparing it for further analysis.

## Current Progress

### 1. API Setup
- Configured and tested the **FastF1 API** to retrieve official Formula 1 race data.

### 2. Data Retrieval
- Successfully fetched race data for a selected Grand Prix.
- Verified data integrity and confirmed compatibility with further processing workflows.

### 3. Local Cache Configuration
- Implemented local caching to store API responses in a dedicated directory (`data/cache/`), reducing redundant API calls and improving performance.

### 4. Data Export
- Processed and exported raw and processed data into **3â€“4 CSV files** for exploratory analysis.
- CSVs are stored in the `data/` folder for easy reference.

## Project Structure 
- will be updated soon


## Future Scope
In the upcoming weeks, we plan to:
- Perform detailed **data cleaning** and feature engineering.
- Integrate **pit stop data**, lap times, and driver telemetry into a unified dataset.
- Build initial **data visualizations** for exploratory analysis.
- Develop the **race prediction model** using historical performance trends.
- Implement scripts for **automated data retrieval** and storage for multiple races.
